## Instructions

This game was built with 8 pair of cards with programmers life-related icons. The objective of the player is to match all the cards with fewer tries. 

When you click in 2 cards and they are different, they will change the color to red, if they are equal, they will change to green.

If you match all the cards you will see a modal with your score:
- up to 15 moves: 3 stars;
- up to 20 moves: 2 stars;
- up to 25 moves: 1 star;
- more than 25 moves: 0 stars.

If you want to restart the game, you can click on the icon next to the "Recome√ßar".
